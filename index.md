            <h2>Immutable..</h2>
            <p>..but also not.</p>
            <p>Vanilla OS is an immutable operating system, core parts of the system are locked down to prevent unwanted changes and corruption from third-party applications or a faulty update. Some paths are still writable, such as the home and configurations directories, this allows the user to keep their files and ensure the normal functioning of applications.</p>
            <p>Core components are only updated via controlled and atomic transactions, which are applied only on success and made available on reboot.</p>
            <p>Need to install a component in the core system? No problem, you can open a transactional shell at any time, make your changes and let the system apply them atomically!</p>

                        <p>Vanilla OS aims to be a stable and compatible distribution. Ubuntu is a distribution that respects both of these canons, being updated with strict control, without having to give up functionality and security.</p>

                        <p>Vanilla OS is a distribution that aims to be stable and reliable, the rolling release model is not always the best choice for this since applications and packages are updated too often, reducing the testing time and increasing the risk of errors.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to Flatpak, Snap and Appimage, the user can always have the latest version of the applications they use, without having to wait for the next release of Vanilla OS.</p>

                        <p>Vanilla OS uses an A/B structure (<a href="https://documentation.vanillaos.org/docs/abroot/">ABRoot</a>), which transacts updates atomically between two root micro partitions. The benefits of this system are the guarantee that the system is altered only when the entire transaction is successful (concept of atomicity), furthermore, the double root partition structure allows you to roll back to the previous state, directly from your boot, you will always have a home to come back to.</p>
                        <p>This structure, unlike others, is compatible with already existing distributions and does not require a complex setup and allows easy re-initialization of the system without data loss.</p>
