Tau shares their journey, the challenges faced, and the community's reaction to the new paradigms introduced in this version.

The purpose of these interviews is to give our community a comprehensive understanding of the development process and the new features of Vanilla OS 2 Orchid, the second version of our operating system, which is set for release soon.

### Tau, could you tell us a bit about you and your role in the Vanilla OS team?

Hi, I'm Tau, a student from Germany. I started to work on Vanilla OS last year when I started off answering questions in the Vanilla OS Discord support channel. Through the interesting questions and problems that people had I got to know the system quite well and finally decided to start contributing code to the project myself.

Now, I'm still answering as many questions as I can while trying to fix the bugs that people encounter.

### How did you get involved with the project and what motivated you to contribute?

I saw a video about Vanilla OS by The Linux Experiment and was immediately sold on the idea. I had a lot of trouble with different distros just breaking on a regular basis when I just wanted to install something or wanted to upgrade. The idea of [ABRoot](https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/ABRoot), where I can just boot back into my old installation if anything goes wrong sounded like the perfect solution to this problem.

### What was it like to join the team during the development of Orchid?

Working on such a big project was pretty intimidating at first. But the team was very helpful when I got stuck somewhere or needed help. And only after a few weeks, I was familiar with the structure of the project.

I'm thankful that the team welcomed me and took my concerns or propositions seriously.

### Can you share some of the challenges you faced while integrating into the team and working on Vanilla OS 2 Orchid?

I think with such a novel OS the biggest problem was agreeing on what it should look like. Everyone has their own opinions on what is good or bad user experience or what trade-offs are reasonable.

The upside of these disagreements was that by everyone sharing what they knew, we came up with quite a few new ideas

### How did you perceive the team environment? Was it structured, flexible, or a mix of both?

I think it was quite flexible since it's an open-source project where everyone has other things to do besides the project.

Sometimes it felt like everyone was on vacation while at other times everyone worked on several things with the team chat getting quite busy. 

### How was the beta of Vanilla OS 2 Orchid perceived by the community?

Since Orchid is a complete overhaul of the OS there were a ton of bugs. Many people were understandably frustrated by them, and I'm thankful to everyone who helped in writing issues or debugging.

But there were many positive reactions as well, mainly about the look and feel and ease of use of the OS, but also from some more technical users who love the way [Vib](https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/Vib) makes building images so much more convenient.

### Do you have any examples of changes or improvements made based on user feedback?

Of course, we could never have found and fixed that many bugs without the community.

But I want to focus on something specific. Many users were unhappy about how difficult it was to get into making your own changes to the core system, so we decided to create the custom-image template on GitHub that gives detailed instructions on how you can create one. I'm happy that quite a few people already started their own image and I'm excited to see what they will create.

### Which feature do you think is the most innovative in Vanilla OS 2 Orchid and why?

While this is very subjective, my favorite thing in Orchid has to be the new [ABRoot](https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/ABRoot). I just love how safe and predictable it makes upgrades and package installs and how it removes the need of ever having to reinstall.

There is still some work to be done until ABRoot is perfect but I think it's already a unique tool with incredible potential.

### What are your thoughts on the future development of Vanilla OS after the release of Orchid?

I think after release will be a very exciting time. I'm especially thrilled for community images that completely rethink the experience with different desktop environments or a completely different target group.

It's also not going to be boring for the team. With so many eyes on the project, we will get countless feature requests or ideas from the community while we're also working on improving the overall experience.

### How can interested individuals contribute to the project and where can they find more information?

I believe that everyone can contribute something to the project if they want to. You don't have to be a developer or designer to make a difference. 

Reporting bugs on GitHub, helping to translate the Vanilla tools, donating money or giving feedback on new changes are all crucial to the success of Vanilla OS.
